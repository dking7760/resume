            Hello, My Name Is Darrell! <img src="images/hounddog.gif" alt="Homework Photo Image" />
        </h1>
        <p><a name="Me" id="Me">About Me:</a></p>
        <div>
        <p>My name is <a href="http://www.zelo.com/firstnames/findresults.asp?name=DARRELL">Darrell</a>
         (Dah-Rell). My name has both old english (from Darel) and old french (from Arielle), origins. 
         However, my friends call me "D" or "Darrio", (my latin friends). And, as a Computer Application Developer, Software Engineer,
         UX/UI Developer, and Team leader, I'm into all types of Computer Technologies.</p>

         <p>My professional career spans more than 18 years in application development, web technology, and project management.
         In addition, I've had pleasure of working for a wide variety of fortune 500 companies in various IT roles and on a array of 
         technology platforms, including; Mainframe, Client Server, and the Greater Internet. However, its the internet where
         I'm most interested in growing my future. That said, my most recent years of development work has been in application 
         development in the areas of; Web Applications, Web Portal, Legacy Application Conversion to Web/Java Application, 
         Web Prototyping, and Web application Maintenance.</p>

         <p>My years of success in IT are directly related to my professional work ethics, organizational skills, attention to details  
            and the trainings that I received from the following education institutions;</p>

            <ul> 
                <li>Professional Certification in Web Technology - HARVARD UNIVERSITY</li>
                <li>Master of Liberal Arts (MLA), Information Management Systems (IMS) - HARVARD UNIVERSITY EXTENSION</li> 
                <li>Master of Business Administration (MBA), International Business - WEBSTER UNIVERSITY</li>
                <li>Bachelor of Liberal Sciences, Minor in Computer Science - UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA</li>  
                <li>Bachelor of Arts, Political Science, Concentration in Pre-Law - UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>So, that's just a little fyi to get through my introduction section. I hope the web links connected with this website will
           help to verify and validate my web development skills and open the doors to any potential opportunities that may arise!</p>

        <p>Also, please keep in mind that this web site is a very, very, very small reflection of my true profesional work. And, this is my
           test site used to reflect my understanding of software technologies that I've tested and learned to use.</p>

          <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>I have both short-term and long-term goals. My immediate short-term goal is to get really good in Web/Mobile
               Technology. However, my long-term goal is to enjoy life and many of the new technologies that are being developed.</p>
            <p>While I have some experience with computers, like I can spell PC, but I like MAC. I'm really looking forward to 
               learning as much as I can about creating dynamic web pages, dynamic web sites, and dynamic internet applications, 
               properly!</p>
